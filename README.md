This is an assignment for the course of Distributed Computing at the University of Genoa (2024). The objective was to create queries using PySpark on a dataset of our liking. Since I worked with @YeeveX, we chosed a shared passion: Formula 1. 
The queries were tested on different conditions, in order to determine their efficiency.
